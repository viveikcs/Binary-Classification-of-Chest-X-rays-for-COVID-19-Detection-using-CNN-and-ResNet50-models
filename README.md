# CNN-Model---Chest-X-Ray-Image-Recognition-to-Detect-COVID-19
Trained and Developed a CNN model for detecting COVID-19 using the concept of binary image classification of the COVID-infected and normal chest X-ray images that were used as the training and testing data. The performance and accuracy of the developed CNN model was compared with a pre-trained ResNet50 CNN model.
